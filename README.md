# Electrode-Utilization-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Pouch-Cell
Constructed a 3D lithium-ion pouch cell model in COMSOL with layered geometry (Cu/Al current collectors, graphite anode, LMO cathode, LiPF6 electrolyte, separator) and implemented particle intercalation kinetics. â€“ Simulated time-dependent charging from 20% to 90% SOC at 4C rate,
